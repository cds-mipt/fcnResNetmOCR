We propose custom OpenTaganrog dataset: https://yadi.sk/d/jjExD7_YiTKqbg?w=1

Custom  OpenTaganrog  dataset consists of rosbag-archives. They include  point  clouds  fromVelodyne  VLP32C  LiDAR,  left  and  right  stereo  camera  images,  and  vehicle  position  and  orientation  from  inertial navigation system.  The recording  was  made  from  a  car  in  urban  traffic  conditions in Taganrog City, Russia. Odometry was obtained from INS Atlans-C in RTK mode withan accuracy of 0.01m. The dataset contains more than 98000 unlabeled  images  from  a  stereo  camera  with  a  resolution  of 1924x1084.
